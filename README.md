# Dotfiles

I have a love affair with my terminal. This is my collection of terminal configuration files that (attempt to) make daily use of the terminal easier, faster, and perhaps even more enjoyable. It’s all about strengthening the bond `;)`.

## Installation

Run `./bin/install`. Rerun whenever updating, as configuration files are locked at the last run time.
